"""GunStore-POS admin MCP server.

Run: `gunstore-mcp` (console script) or `python -m gunstore_mcp.server`.

Transports (GUNSTORE_MCP_TRANSPORT): "stdio" (default) = the local server, one
API key from mcp/.env (see .env.example); "http" = the remote connector — an
OAuth resource server whose authorization server is the POS itself. It holds no
key: every request carries the signed-in user's bearer token, verified against
the POS (auth.FrappeTokenVerifier) and forwarded on every call.

Modes (GUNSTORE_MCP_MODE): "full" (default) = the whole surface; "cpa" = the
read-only accountant surface (exactly the tools in modes.CPA_TOOL_NAMES; the
write tools are never registered).

GUNSTORE_MCP_DISTRIBUTOR_ACTIONS=1 additionally opts into the 4 distributor queue
actions, which are NOT registered otherwise. Sizes are asserted in tests rather
than restated here — this docstring is where the last stale count lived."""
