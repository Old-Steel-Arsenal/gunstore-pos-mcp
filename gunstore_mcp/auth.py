"""Remote-connector auth — this server is an OAuth *resource server* for the POS.

The POS (Frappe) is the authorization server: the connector registers itself
there, the user signs in to the POS and approves, and every request then arrives
with that user's bearer token. This module only answers "is this a live token of
a POS user, issued to a connector?" — by asking the POS itself
(ffl_core.api.connector.connector_identity) — so no key, secret or user database
lives here. Tokens issued to OAuth apps created in Desk are refused: only a
client made by dynamic registration (a connector) may drive the MCP. The same
token is then forwarded on every Frappe call (frappe_client.get_client), so each
call runs with that user's own roles.
