"""Server modes — the cpa read-only gate.

`GUNSTORE_MCP_MODE=cpa` turns the server into an accountant-facing, read-only
surface with three independent defence layers (each fails closed on its own):

  1. Registration (this module's FilteredMCP + CPA_TOOL_NAMES): only the
     allowlisted tools exist in tools/list — the write surface is
     physically absent, not merely guarded.
  2. Client (frappe_client.py): every mutating client method refuses in cpa
     mode, and dotted methods are checked against CPA_METHOD_ALLOWLIST —
     names listed one by one, NO prefix wildcards, NO HTTP-verb heuristics
     (run_report rides POST-adjacent /api/method GET; verbs prove nothing).
  3. Settings reads: the 9 integration Settings doctypes refuse get/list in
     cpa mode — Password masking is a framework behaviour, not this repo's
     guarantee, and the config surface has no accounting purpose.

Allowlist caliber authority: runs/2026-07-16-mcp-cpa-mode/cpa-review.md §4
(9 curated reads kept, 6 cut — available_serials excluded because its
exclude_unavailable=True default silently drops consigned/held guns, which is
exactly wrong in a stock-count/audit context).
