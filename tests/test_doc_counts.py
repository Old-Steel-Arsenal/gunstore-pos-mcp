"""Documentation-vs-code drift on TOOL COUNTS.

Why this file exists: the tool total has now been wrong or under-tracked THREE times
(the meta-note said it was pinned in 3 places, then 5, then 6 — each time because a
new spot quoted the number and nobody knew). Hand-maintained lists of "places to
update" decay by construction; the fix is to make the count self-checking.

Two layers, because they fail differently:

* **exact claims** — the canonical sentence in each doc must equal the live count,
  bucket by bucket. If a doc is rephrased so the regex no longer matches, that is a
  FAILURE, not a silent pass: a drift test that quietly finds nothing is exactly the
  blanket-stub trap (a check that cannot fail proves nothing).
* **the sweep** — ANY "<N> tools" / "<N> 工具" claim anywhere in the package, the
  docs, or the tests must be a number that is actually true of the surface. This is
  what catches stale prose far from the pins: `server.py` still advertised a
  "67-tool surface" and a test docstring still said "67 tools", neither of which any
  per-file pin was ever going to notice.
