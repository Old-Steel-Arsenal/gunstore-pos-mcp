"""Guards in safety.py — the credential backstop and the never-writes layer.

This file did not exist before PR-4a. Its absence is why a gap in
`_CREDENTIAL_NAME` went unnoticed: the regex is the fallback for when doctype
meta cannot be fetched, which is exactly the path no other test exercises.

The two mechanisms here fail differently and are tested differently:

* **strip_passwords** removes credential fields and reports what it removed. It
  must hold up with an EMPTY meta set, because `strip_passwords` swallows a
  failed describe on purpose ("a describe hiccup must never block a legitimate
  write") — on that path the name regex is the only thing standing between a
  DevKey and the conversation.
* **check_fields_writable** refuses the whole call. Nothing is stripped,
  nothing half-applies.
